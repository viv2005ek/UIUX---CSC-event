## 🚀 Animation Principles

1. **Consistency**: All animations use centralized tokens
2. **Purpose**: Every animation improves UX or guides attention
3. **Performance**: GPU-accelerated, 60fps target
4. **Accessibility**: Respects reduced motion preferences
5. **Timing**: Coordinated with stagger delays
6. **Easing**: Natural, physics-based curves
7. **Feedback**: Immediate response to interactions
8. **Delight**: Subtle surprise moments throughout

## 📊 Technical Improvements
